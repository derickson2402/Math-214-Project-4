\section{Area of Study}

These days, it is commonplace to share hundreds if not thousands of pictures over the internet each day, whether through social media, Zoom calls, or sharing pictures of your spring break trip with your family. Storing and sending this many images takes a lot of storage and internet bandwidth, so it is hugely important to reduce the original size of digital images while retaining as much of the information enclosed as possible. We wish to explore the application of Linear Algebra in digital image compression, specifically the methods using wavelet-based algorithms. Our goal is to look at how the JPEG-2000 compression standard is implemented, why it performs better than older standards especially at higher compression ratios, and how the process could potentially be improved.
